Presentation of [neural style][ppt].

Style transfer is the technique of recomposing images in the style of other images.
## Dependencies

    tensorflow
    matplotlib
    python 3
    
## Examples

## What does the paper do?
* Create artistic images of high perceptual quality.
* The key observation: the representations of content and style of an image in the Convolutional Neural Networks are separable.
* Use a pre-trained VGG-19 (average pooling) to ﬁnd another image simultaneously matches the content of a photograph and the style of a piece of art work.</br> </br>

## Loss
### Content representation and loss:
Given a chosen content layer l, the content loss is defined as the Mean Squared Error between the feature map F of our content image C and the feature map P of our generated image Y.   </br>

When this content-loss is minimized, it means that the mixed-image has feature activation in the given layers that are very similar to the activation of the content-image.

### Style representation and loss:
If the feature map is a matrix F, then each entry is in the Gram matrix G  </br>

The loss function for style is quite similar to out content loss, except that we calculate the Mean Squared Error for the Gram-matrices instead of the raw tensor-outputs from the layers.  </br>
